My process
Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Responsive design using media queries
Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements
What I learned
In this project, I focused on fine-tuning the layout using the position property to ensure precise placement of elements like images and text. For example, I used the position: relative and position: absolute properties to position elements dynamically:

css
.image-container {
  position: relative;
}

Continued development
I plan to explore more advanced layout techniques for future projects, such as CSS Grid for more complex recipe pages and adding JavaScript-based filtering functionality for recipe categories.
